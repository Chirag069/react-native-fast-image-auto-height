# FAQ

### Is this a wrapper around FastImage?

It is an architecture layer over the FastImage engine. The native pipeline (Glide/SDWebImage, priorities, cache control, preloading) comes from `react-native-fast-image`; everything above it — automatic sizing, the aspect-ratio cache, request deduplication, retries, placeholders, transitions, lazy loading, and the typed public API — is this library. When you use no new props, the render output is exactly one native FastImage.

### Why depend on `react-native-fast-image` instead of forking the native code?

Maintaining forked Glide/SDWebImage bindings is a large ongoing cost. Delegating to the engine package keeps this library focused on sizing, caching, and UX. The dependency is isolated behind a single file (`InternalFastImage.tsx`), so the engine can be swapped in a one-file change if the ecosystem moves.

### Does it work with the New Architecture?

This library's own code is pure TypeScript and renderer-agnostic. New Architecture support depends on the installed `react-native-fast-image` version and your React Native setup.

### How is the height calculated before the image loads?

In priority order: the in-memory ratio cache (synchronous), your `estimatedAspectRatio` (provisional), then the first of the image's `onLoad` dimensions or a deduplicated `Image.getSize` probe. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Why is the size cache not persisted to disk?

Because a URL's image can change server-side (merchant CDNs do this constantly), and a stale persisted ratio would silently break layouts. Persistence will ship as an opt-in plugin (`SizeCacheStorage`) for apps with immutable URLs.

### Does `autoHeight` work with `width: '100%'` or flex widths?

Yes — the width is measured once via `onLayout` (a single frame, masked by `estimatedAspectRatio` or a `placeholder`), then the height is derived from it.

### Can I use both `autoHeight` and `autoWidth`?

No — one dimension must anchor the other. The library throws in development if you combine them.

### Do local images (`require(...)`) trigger network probes?

Never. Local assets resolve synchronously from the packager's asset registry.

### What happens if the size probe fails?

With `retryCount` set, it retries with `retryDelay` between attempts. If everything fails, the hook reports `status: 'failed'` and — if `estimatedAspectRatio` is set — the provisional layout simply remains. The failure is not cached, so a future mount retries.

### Is `onSizeResolved` called for cached images?

Yes, exactly once per source per mount — synchronously-cached resolutions report `fromCache: true`.

### Does `lazy` detect viewport visibility?

Not yet. In v1 `lazy` defers loading until the JS thread is idle. Viewport-based visibility detection is planned and will extend the same prop without breaking it.

### GIF, WebP, AVIF, SVG?

Format support comes from the engine: GIF, WebP and AVIF work as in `react-native-fast-image` (SVG via their documented setup).

### Can I build my own component on this infrastructure?

Yes — `useImageDimensions`, `useAutoHeight` and `useAutoWidth` are public exports backed by the same cache and deduplication.
